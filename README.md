# Bulk image resizer

## Usage

1. Drag and drop all images you want to resize onto the executable. All images need to have the same width and height. 
2. Input desired new width of the image. Aspect ratio is locked.
3. Resized images will be written to the same directory as the source image and will be prefixed with the new width and height.

## Disclaimer

I made this tool to solve my own bulk resize needs. No optimizations or error handling has been added.
